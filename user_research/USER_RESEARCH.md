#User Research Notes
###April 03, 2015

####**Citation (CPA):** Interview with Market Client Lead, April 2, 2015.
* Existing functionality: RSS Feed type functionality that sends curated information directly to the firm
* Suggests reaching out to 
 * BDCOE research
 * Price to win team
* A few things to keep in mind
 * the type of business that you are informs how you use it (small business vs. large defense contractor)
 * Type of agency is important, and each one is different in terms of how they make the information available
* Search
 * Current system uses uses Lucene search engine 
 * If there’s something to help people filter, that’d be great
* Buyer vs. vendor terminology is important

####**Citation (CPA):** Interview with Digital Engagement Strategy Lead, April 2, 2015.
* Can’t search RFP changes – not highlighted (revisions, can’t see)
* Search function is hard to use (overwhelming, doesn’t get you what you want to see)

####**Citation (CPA):** Interview with GSA Business Development Lead, April 2, 2015.
* Office does not have the bandwidth to use FedBizOpps on a regular basis
* Usually uses the site to track specific solicitation numbers and monitor for updates
* Also uses other procurement data sources: ITSF Procurement Portal, GovWin, EBuy
* A lot of information is housed in the site, which is great, but doing a search (e.g., for Veteran’s Affairs) returns thousands of opportunities
* Insight into relevant opportunities comes from other outside sources, it doesn’t start with FedBizOpps because the effort is too high

####**Citation (CPA):** Interview with Market Sensing and Development Lead, April 2, 2015.
* Power user, uses the system often, familiar with the functionality
* Has been using FedBizOpps when it went through its last update in 2008
* 2008 updates: enhanced e-mail functionality, access to better opportunity update information, search overhaul
* Two areas for improvement
 * (1) Contractor’s perspective: an export functionality would be helpful
 * Could access raw data to feed into analytic tools
 * Analytics/visualization functionality is more helpful than raw data
 * Would help power users get a high-level understanding
 * opportunities
 * Search visualizations by geographic location would be helpful
 * (2) Search capability
 * Fairly simple for power users
 * Should include keyword and solicitation search
 * Should include capability of digging into attachments (parsing that language as well)
* Current search challenge: can search by organization (office w/in agency), but it’s hard to do
 * Data quality: a lot of opportunities are tagged by contracting org
 * What users want is to have it by client
 * Suggestion: pull out the true client organization on the back end
 * E.g., for the Army market: Contracting office = APG Aberdeen Proving Ground C4, Client offices = PEO (Program Executive Offices) and CCOM
 * Users often don’t know the solicitation number going in
 * The challenge is finding the searches that are relevant to you
 * Most important search factors: organization and capability (e.g., C4, Engineering, Systems Development)
* Suggestion: GovWin and DelTek use NAICs codes (granular building blocks) – North American Industrial Classification system, and we could roll them to roll into a taxonomy 

####**Citation (CPA):** Interview with Civil Market Sensing and Development Lead, April 2, 2015.
* User Background
 * Power user—knows where to find, how to find, and how to get around pretty quickly
 * Provides all market study and market pipeline analysis for civil market
 * Tasked with providing insight into trends over the next five years, key news, incumbent statuses, and any issues
 * Always looking for: name, contract number, solicitation number, solicitation date, award date, expiration, value, incumbent, agency (department, agency, bureau), info on the program
* Overall Throughts
 * Information not presented in a friendly way
 * Would be helpful to have visualization
* Challenges on current site
 * information can only go back one year, cannot see further back
 * On home page: can only look at solicitation number, but cannot look at contract number; cannot do any research by incumbent company name; can only do research by agency, but not by department (which is one level down); cannot do research by NAICs code (keyword, but not code)
 * does not link to other government data source subsets (e.g., budget information from agencies, Federal Procurement Database System)
 * does not include incumbent contractor and protest information
* Govwin is a better resource, but you need a subscription 
 * Includes historical data for opportunities (e.g., recompete status, budget and spending)
 * Like FedBizOpps, lacking relationship to budget, but that is something to be solved on the COTAR side
* Everything has to be easily searchable (standardized format, or a way to search the information in attachments)
* People who are new have a lot of problem accessing and navigating

####**Citation (CPA):** Interview with Federal Service Desk Representative, April 2, 2015.
* NAICS codes = specified to business = short descriptions of what your business does
* Classification codes: big picture

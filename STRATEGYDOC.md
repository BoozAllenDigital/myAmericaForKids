#Skills Management Platform Strategy Document
###March 22, 2015
---

*A Note on Semantics*

For our purposes, “technologies” and “tasks” are each a smaller subset of “skills.”
Identifying technologies and tasks that are relevant to a specific occupation creates “technology-occupation combinations” and “task-occupation combinations,” both of which are “skills combinations.”

*Approach and Background*

In evaluating the parameters of the Agile Delivery Services challenge, we decided that the true value proposition of a skills management platform is the ability to maintain up-to-date and accurate information about occupational skills. To that end, the X PLATFORM has three core functionalities: 

1)	Allows users to rate the relevance of existing technology and task skills for a specific occupation

2)	Enables users to propose new technology and task skills to be added to a specific occupation 

3)	Recommends new technology- and task-occupation combinations to the O-NET system of record

*Users - Overview*

The X PLATFORM serves two types of users, all of whom will be required to create an account upon sign up. General users will be able to browse the data, rate the relevance of existing skill-occupation combinations, and vote on proposed skill-occupation combinations. Curators have all the general user capabilities, and can also propose new skill-occupation combinations. The purpose of having two groups of users is to create parameters that help ensure only serious skill-occupation combinations are proposed.

*Users – Becoming a Curator*

There are two tracks to becoming a curator. The first is through a credentialing system. We identified HR representatives and education professionals<sup>1</sup> as two groups of potential users that possess unique insights into the types of technology and task skills that are relevant to specific jobs. HR representatives and academics that are interested in becoming a curator will be required to provide proof of HR certification<sup>2</sup> or of academic professional association membership<sup>3</sup> respectively. A site administrator will then verify the credential and grant users curator privileges.

The second is through a reputation system. We believe that general users also possess the experience and knowledge required to propose important skill-occupation combinations. In order to ensure that such individuals are recognized, users who are able to gain a certain reputation score will also be invited to become curators. A reputation score is a composite of inputs such as the user’s activity (number of votes, numbers of ratings, etc.); subject matter expertise (how close votes and ratings accorded with the collective average); and peer feedback (whether other users vouch for the individual).

<sup>1</sup>Includes, but is not limited to: educators and administrators in high schools, community colleges, and 4-year colleges/universities

<sup>2</sup>Includes, but is not limited to: the Professional in Human Resources (PHR) and Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR) 

<sup>3</sup>Includes, but is not limited to: American Association of Community Colleges, American Association for Higher Education, American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers

*Future Functionality – Analytics*

One of the key benefits of X PLATFORM’S ability to track up-to-date occupation and skill information is the potential for data mining and analytics. Future functionality that synthesizes and visualizes the data in a useful manner would provide significant real world employment and career development decisions. For example, let’s say that trend data for the React JavaScript library technology has seen a sustained increase in ratings over the past year. A software developer could use that data to decide to learn how to use the technology, HR representative could decide to add React.js familiarity to their list of job candidate requirements, and a community college professor could incorporate it into their computer programming course curriculum.
